# üß† Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of machine learning projects! This repository serves as a central hub for various assignments, side projects, and experiments I've worked on‚Äîcovering supervised and unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, model evaluation, and more.

Each project is contained in its own subfolder with relevant code, data (or links to datasets), and a `README.md` explaining the goal, approach, and results.

## üìÅ Contents

- `dimensionality-reduction/`(PCA-Eigenfaces)  
  Dimensionality reduction using PCA and visualization of eigenfaces with the Yale Faces dataset.
  
- `linear-regression-cf/` (Closed Form Linear Regression)\
Implementation of linear regression using the closed-form (normal equation) method on medical cost data, including preprocessing, evaluation metrics (RMSE, SMAPE), and custom k-fold cross-validation.

...

## üß™ Topics Covered

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Supervised Learning: Decision Trees, Linear Regression
- Unsupervised Learning: K-Means Clustering
- Model Evaluation: Confusion Matrices, Accuracy
- Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Python-based ML implementations (no external libraries unless noted)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Some projects may require libraries such as:

```bash
