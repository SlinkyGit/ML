# Logistic Regression Classifier

This project implements a logistic regression model from scratch using NumPy, with gradient descent optimization. It includes training/validation evaluation and visualizes performance through a loss curve.

## Features

- Logistic Regression from first principles
- Gradient descent with customizable learning rate and epochs
- Train/validation split with metric tracking
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
- Log-loss visualization using Matplotlib

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Place the dataset (e.g., `insurance.csv`) in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python logistic_regression_classifier.py
